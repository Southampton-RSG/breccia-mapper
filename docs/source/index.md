The BRECcIA Network Mapper [(view on GitHub)](https://github.com/Southampton-RSG/breccia-mapper) is a web app designed to track and quantify personnel networks & relationships - primarily developed for use in research projects. It is designed for global use across many different organisations involved in a single project, and has been utilised as part of [BRECcIA](https://gcrf-breccia.com) itself.

It can be deployed by individuals or organisations, and supports login with username/password, Google, and Microsoft.

This work was funded through the "Building REsearch Capacity for sustainable water and food security In drylands of sub-saharan Africa" (BRECcIA) project which is supported by UK Research and Innovation as part of the Global Challenges Research Fund, grant number NE/P021093/1.
