Welcome to the BRECcIA Relationship Mapper documentation
========================================================

The BRECcIA Relationship Mapper is a web app designed to track and quantify the the relationships between personnel - primarily developed for use in research projects. It is designed for global use across many different organisations involved in a single project, and has been utilised in [the BRECcIA project](https://gcrf-breccia.com) itself.

This work was funded through the "Building REsearch Capacity for sustainable water and food security In drylands of sub-saharan Africa" (BRECcIA) project which is supported by UK Research and Innovation as part of the Global Challenges Research Fund, grant number NE/P021093/1.

.. note::
